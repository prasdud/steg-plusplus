I was up to my waist in debt, better yet, face and neck, tryna chase a check
Sweat, labor for minimal as wages get, just tryna get me a dub like a blank cassette (Yeah)
I worked for peanuts 'til the day I met Dre and that gave me a little raise in net
Now nothing is close to disgusting as what I grossed, so this must mean what I wrote makes me the
Illest rapper there is, was, or ever will be
That's the real reason I still squeeze and I fill these bars with so much vitriol
These voices in my head convince me, I bet that Ted Kaczynski'll feel me
'Cause I serial-kill beats like Israel Keyes
My peripheral sees everything, you was POVs to rap G-O-D
From Little Caesars to filled arenas, I made it big, word to Lil' Cease
"Fuel" remix, so who'll be picked next, whose name gonna be next up?
Notorious B.I.G.'s death was the domino effects of 2Pac's murder
Like facial tissue, whose clock should I clean next? Puff's?
'Til he's in police handcuffs, guilty, will he step up
Like G. Dep and turn himself in? Who knows all the murders they'll pin
On me next, so prepare for me to not choose none of my words carefully
I've been comparable to Ivan The Terrible, I'll take a paraplegic
And I'll slam his wheelchair on the cement at physical therapy treatment
Then laugh hysterically, these wimps are like Slim's hair when he bleached it
Y'all need to lighten up, I give a fuck, I don't care in the least bit
Kiss every square inch of my white rear end, I guarantee
That my elevator's stuck somewhere between two levels emcees won't ever see
I spit bars so barbarically, a fuckin' parakeet wouldn't dare repeat
I'll never be runnin' out of steam or kerosene
